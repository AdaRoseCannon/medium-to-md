# MediumExport
Export your stories published on medium.com to markdown for easy import 

I use markdown to edit my own personal blog but lately I really enjoyed using [Medium](https://medium.com) to publish a few posts. 

That said, I'd love to have a copy of those posts on my own blog, so that's why I'm building this exporter.

I welcome contributions to make it work also in raw HTML or any other format that could be easily imported in whatever blogging engine that you are using.
